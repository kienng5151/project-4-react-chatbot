## React Simple Chatbot

react-simple-chatbot is a simple library which we can pass the flow of the conversation as props.\
A simple chatbot component to create conversation chats.

This is a chatbot for simple medical diagnosis.\
The chatbot asks a few questions about common symptoms you have in relation to Covid-19.\
Of course, the chatbot didn't say those questions are for Covid-19 check.\
It's a rather sensitive bot after all.

## Challenges

This library seems easy to use. But for a beginner like me who has just learned some basic React, it takes a while to get the hang of using this library.
